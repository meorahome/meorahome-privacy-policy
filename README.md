# Privacy Policy — Meora Home

Last updated: February 13, 2026

## Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes how Meora Home handles information in connection with our Pinterest content management application ("meorahome etsy Content Management").

## What Our App Does
Our application is a personal content scheduling and management tool used exclusively by the Meora Home account owner to preview and select product images for publishing, draft pin titles and descriptions, and schedule selected pins to chosen Pinterest boards. All actions are initiated and approved by the account owner. No content is published without user review and confirmation. The app is not available to the general public.

## Data Collection
Our application does not collect, store, or process any personal data from Pinterest users. We only access our own Pinterest account to manage and publish our own content to our own boards.

## Data Usage
We use the Pinterest API solely to read our own board information, create pins on our own boards, and view basic analytics of our own pins. No data obtained through the Pinterest API is used for any other purpose.

## Data Sharing
We do not share, sell, rent, or transfer any data obtained through the Pinterest API to any third parties under any circumstances.

## Data Storage
We do not store any Pinterest user data. API access tokens are stored securely and used solely for authentication purposes. No Pinterest data is cached or retained beyond the immediate session.

## Data Deletion
As we do not collect or store Pinterest user data, there is no user data to delete. If you have any concerns, please contact us using the information below.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated revision date.
